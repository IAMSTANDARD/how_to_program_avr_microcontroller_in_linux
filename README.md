This is a guide on how to program avr microcontrollers in Linux. If you don't know how to, it is useful.

## Why in Linux?
Just in case, if you don't or can't program on your windows machine. You should know, that you can still program it on Linux.

## What it achieves.
It only achieves programming of the microcontroller. This repository does not have anything related to writing the code for the microcontroller, or really anything. It's not for some specific microcontroller. It's for most, or all AVR mcirocontroller.

### Required
- You need a USBasp, in order to be able to program your microcnotroller. Or just use an arduino as USBasp.

- Also have some basic required circuitry for your microcontroller. See that in the datasheet. Or just buy, or search up some development board for that microcontroller.  


These instructions were copied from stack overflow. But I do not know what thread it was.
